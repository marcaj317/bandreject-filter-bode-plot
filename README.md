# bandreject-filter-bode-plot
Consider designing a broadband Butterworth bandreject filter with a lower corner frequency of 300 Hz and an upper corner frequency of 4500Hz. The passband gain of the filter is 20 dB. The gain should be down at least 30 dB at 1000Hz. Use 15 nF capacitors in the high-pass circuit and 10 kâ„¦ resistors in the low-pass circuit.

After designing the circuit, verify the bode plot of the transfer function of the bandreject filter using Matlab.
